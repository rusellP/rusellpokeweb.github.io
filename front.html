                                    <p>Legendary Pokémon (Japanese: 伝説のポケモン Legendary Pokémon) are a group of incredibly rare and often very powerful Pokémon,
                                    generally featured prominently in the legends and myths of the Pokémon world.
                                    
                                    Special Pokémon is a subcategory of the Legendary Pokémon that are restricted or banned from certain official
                                    tournaments, battle facilities, and link battle formats. Most Special Pokémon are Legendary game mascots.
                                    
                                    Mythical Pokémon are a related but separate group of Pokémon, which are usually event-exclusive. In Western language
                                    media, Mythical Pokémon were considered to be Legendary Pokémon prior to Generation V; in Japanese and Korean media, the
                                    two groups have always been considered distinct.
                                    
                                    No explicit criteria defines what makes a Pokémon a Legendary Pokémon. Instead, the only way to identify a Pokémon as
                                    belonging to this group is through statements from official media, such as the games or anime.</p>

                    <h1>Pokémon Movie</h1>
                    <p>A Pokémon movie is a theatrical film usually released in Japan in July, centering on Pokémon and following, as the main
                    anime series, Ash and his friends. Typically, the movies' animation is done by Team Koitabashi of OLM, and each has at
                    least one hour of footage. Nine of the movies also have a Pikachu short that is shown before the main feature, and all
                    of them have a manga adaptation.
                    
                    The locations in which the movies take place have been, since Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias, based on real-world
                    locations outside of Japan. Topics explored are typically deeper than those explored in the episodes aired on
                    television, usually featuring Ash and his friends confronting antagonists who wish to use Pokémon for selfish purposes.
                    Nearly every movie involves Legendary Pokémon, and many of them debut a Mythical Pokémon belonging to the ongoing
                    generation of the core series games, with event distributions for certain Pokémon featuring in the movie running
                    concurrently.
                    
                    To date, there have been 23 theatrical Pokémon movies and three movie-length special episodes. There has also been one
                    live-action movie, Detective Pikachu. Additionally, the miniseries Pokémon Origins is a similar length to a movie when
                    all of the episodes are combined.</p>
